## 🧠 Overview

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate the value of residential homes. By applying smart regression techniques such as ensemble learning, regularization, and feature engineering, we achieve a robust and accurate forecasting system.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

We use the [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) which includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## 🔍 Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection & Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Ensemble Techniques (Stacking, Blending)

## 🤖 Modeling Techniques

We experimented with multiple regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Stacked Generalization (Ensemble)

## 🚀 Usage
